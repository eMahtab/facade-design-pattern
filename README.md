# Facade Pattern


![Facade Pattern](facade-pattern.png?raw=true)


## Facade Example
![Facade example](facade-example.JPG?raw=true)

Instead of making your code work with dozens of the framework classes directly, you create a facade class which encapsulates that functionality and hides it from the rest of the code. This structure also helps you to minimize the effort of upgrading to future versions of the framework or replacing it with another one. The only thing you’d need to change in your app would be the implementation of the facade’s methods.

```
class VideoFile
// ...

class OggCompressionCodec
// ...

class MPEG4CompressionCodec
// ...

class CodecFactory
// ...

class BitrateReader
// ...

class AudioMixer
// ...


// We create a facade class to hide the framework's complexity
// behind a simple interface. It's a trade-off between
// functionality and simplicity.
class VideoConverter is
    method convert(filename, format):File is
        file = new VideoFile(filename)
        sourceCodec = new CodecFactory.extract(file)
        if (format == "mp4")
            destinationCodec = new MPEG4CompressionCodec()
        else
            destinationCodec = new OggCompressionCodec()
        buffer = BitrateReader.read(filename, sourceCodec)
        result = BitrateReader.convert(buffer, destinationCodec)
        result = (new AudioMixer()).fix(result)
        return new File(result)

// Application classes don't depend on a a lot of classes
// provided by the complex framework. Also, if you decide to
// switch frameworks, you only need to rewrite the facade class.
class Application is
    method main() is
        convertor = new VideoConverter()
        mp4 = convertor.convert("funny-cats-video.ogg", "mp4")
        mp4.save()
```
